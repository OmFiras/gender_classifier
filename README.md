# gender_classifier
Octave/Matlab program to classify gender of Nepali names as male and female.

Clone the project in your local device and implement in Matlab/octave environment.
Run "gender_predictor.m" and then enter your name.
The program classifies your name as male or female depending on last three letters.
It does not give 100% accurate result but classifies fairly to about 85% of the data.

In the next update, hopefully, I will come up with some changes that amounts to 90+ percentage of accuracy.
